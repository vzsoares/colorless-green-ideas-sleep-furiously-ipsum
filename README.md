> "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" - _Noam Chomsky_

A sophisticated nonsensical text generator inspired by Chomsky's famous example of a grammatically correct but semantically meaningless sentence. When you need placeholder text that challenges perception and ignites intellectual curiosity, reach for this instead of Lorem Ipsum.

## üß† The Philosophy Behind It

While traditional Lorem Ipsum text serves as neutral filler, Colorless Green Ideas Ipsum challenges the very notion of meaning. By combining intellectually stimulating philosophical terms in grammatically correct but semantically vacant constructions, it creates text that simultaneously feels profound and meaningless‚Äîperfect for projects seeking a more intellectually engaging alternative to standard placeholder text.

## üìã Usage Examples

### Web Interface

Simply:

1. Adjust the sliders for paragraph count and sentences per paragraph
2. Click "Generate Text"
3. Copy the results with one click

### TypeScript Class

```typescript
// Create a new generator instance
const generator = new ColorlessGreenIpsumGenerator();

// Generate 3 paragraphs with 4 sentences each
const philosophicalNonsense = generator.generateIpsum(3, 4);
console.log(philosophicalNonsense);
```

### Sample Output

> Teleological phenomena of metaphysical dialectics systematize intrinsically. Epistemologically, transparent axioms meditate. Dialectical epistemologies reify the qualia of being. Ontological monads subsume, notwithstanding phenomenological axioms particularize heuristically.
>
> Apophatic frameworks deterritorialize categorically. Transcendental noumena of hermeneutic quiddities presuppose intrinsically. Metaphysical abstractions ontologize, ergo solipsistic essences sublimate apodictically. Phenomenologically, noumenal aporia delineate.
